# H. pylori Detection through Endoscopic Images
This repository contains the complete implementation and experimentation for my university Final Year Project, detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) through endoscopic images using deep learning models.

# Project Overview
Helicobacter pylori is a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach and is a known risk factor for ulcers and gastric cancer. Early detection through endoscopy can be challenging due to visual similarities with other conditions. This project explores the application of various deep learning techniques to accurately detect H. pylori in endoscopic images.

## Models and Tech
Worked on the following: 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Transfer Learning models (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, DenseNet)

Custom Hybrid Architectures

## Dataset
We obtained the dataset from a reputable hospital and because of privacy concerns and HIPAA the dataset is not included.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated based on:

Accuracy

Precision / Recall / F1-Score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix
